		<h2>About Nalin</h2>
		<p>Hi, I am Nalin Chopra. I am 23 years old and live in Pleasanton, California. I am half Indian, a quarter Japanese, and a quarter Danish, making me somewhat of a mix. My hobbies include reading, playing pc games, watching sports and esports, and playing board and table top games with my friends.</p>

		<h2>My Experience</h2>
		<p>My experience with programming is fairly limited so far. My first experience with it was when I was much younger at ACE computer camp that I went to for a few weeks in the summer. My other experience was interning at a start up. I didn't get the chance to play with code first hard there because everyone was so busy, but I got to see how ideas were implemented into the code to show up on the product, and that really motivated me to want to learn to code myself.</p>
